* Listify is a modified version of AddressBook-Level3 which was done as a project by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org). <br>
* It is designed to streamline contact management for tech-savy fast-typing event organisers.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Seamless import and export of contacts via VCF
  * Quick and efficient contact management
  * Easy and intuitive contact search
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called Listify) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Listify` and it was created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Listify Product Website](https://ay2425s2-cs2103-f09-3.github.io/tp/index.html)**.
